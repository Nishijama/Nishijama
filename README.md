Hi, I’m Filip

👨‍💻 I’m a second-year student of computer science and an analyst at McKinsey & Co with over 5 years of experience in corporate environment.

🌐 I’m currently focusing on mastering python and javascript for web development and data analysis.

📙 I love foreign languages - I studied english philology at a university and I'm learining Japanese on my own.

🌱 I'm still learning, but I hope to contribute to open source projects soon!
