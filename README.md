Hi, I’m Filip

👨‍💻 I’m a second-year student of computer science and an analyst at McKinsey & Co.

🌐 I’m currently focusing on mastering python for web development, automation and data analysis.

📙 I love foreign languages - I studied english philology and I'm learining Japanese on my own.

🌱 I'm still learning, but I hope to contribute to open source projects soon!

📯 You can find my contact details [here](https://nishijama.github.io/AboutMe/)

Thank you for stopping by!
